Julius is an outstanding and professional service provider. He & his team installed an outdoor security system over a large area. He made sure that all of our needs were met at all phases: sale, installation, and even after the system was installed. We have worked with several contractors and many of them have lacked customer service skills, professionalism, and common courtesy. Julius and his team had to dig trenches and bring along tools/equipment, but they were careful not to damage our property and did not leave debris behind. Security Consult is a great business to work with!
