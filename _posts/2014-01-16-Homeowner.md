After about a month, we experienced some technical issues with their previous installation. Julian had his guys out immediately to resolve the issue which proved to be a little more problematic than anticipated. Subsequently they scheduled timely follow-up troubleshooting and repair appointments, were prompt, polite, professional and very neat. They stuck with the job until it was accomplished. Very satisfied with the attentiveness, can do attitude and overall quality service.
